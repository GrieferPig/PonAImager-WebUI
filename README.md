### WARN: Under heavy development, please do not use in production environments.

A web UI for Stable Diffusion similiar to [stable-diffusion-ui](https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui) but with a modern design _and much LESS options because I am a noob and I don't know what does they do.

### Features

- Modern material design, robust user interface, fine-tuned website for fast loading speed (400KiB~ data transmitted without cache on loading)
- Highly customizable through config.json, should be compatible with most models trained with Stable Diffusion pipeline.
- Easy to set up & launch without any programming skills needed (but you should be familiar with command lines which is fairly easy)
- PWA Support! You may install this as a desktop app for a better experience.
- More to come

Refer to [the wiki](https://github.com/GrieferPig/PonAImager-WebUI/wiki/) for installation guide & more
